# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature focuses on optimizing the handling and display of non-streaming output results in the multi-LLM comparator application. Currently, the application processes model outputs through a streaming mechanism even when complete results are available, which can lead to inefficient resource usage and suboptimal user experience. This optimization will provide direct, efficient handling of complete model outputs while maintaining the existing streaming capabilities for real-time generation scenarios.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a user comparing multiple LLM models, I want non-streaming results to be displayed immediately and efficiently, so that I can quickly review complete outputs without unnecessary delays or resource overhead.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a model generates a complete output in non-streaming mode THEN the system SHALL display the full result immediately without token-by-token rendering
2. WHEN multiple models complete their inference simultaneously THEN the system SHALL update all result displays concurrently without sequential delays
3. WHEN a user switches between streaming and non-streaming modes THEN the system SHALL adapt the display mechanism accordingly within 100ms
4. WHEN non-streaming results are available THEN the system SHALL consume at least 30% less CPU resources compared to streaming display mode

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a developer integrating with the LLM comparator, I want a clear API distinction between streaming and non-streaming inference modes, so that I can optimize my application's performance based on the use case.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN calling the inference engine THEN the system SHALL provide separate methods for streaming and non-streaming inference
2. WHEN using non-streaming mode THEN the system SHALL return complete InferenceResult objects without intermediate token updates
3. WHEN using non-streaming mode THEN the system SHALL skip token-level progress callbacks and provide only status-level updates
4. WHEN switching inference modes THEN the system SHALL maintain backward compatibility with existing streaming implementations

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a user with limited system resources, I want non-streaming output to use memory more efficiently, so that I can run comparisons on resource-constrained environments.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN processing non-streaming outputs THEN the system SHALL avoid storing intermediate token states in memory
2. WHEN multiple models complete inference THEN the system SHALL batch memory cleanup operations to reduce overhead
3. WHEN displaying non-streaming results THEN the system SHALL use direct content rendering instead of progressive text building
4. WHEN non-streaming mode is active THEN the system SHALL reduce memory usage by at least 25% compared to streaming mode

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a user performing batch comparisons, I want non-streaming results to be cached and reused efficiently, so that I can avoid redundant computations when reviewing the same prompts.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a non-streaming inference completes THEN the system SHALL cache the complete result with prompt and model configuration as keys
2. WHEN the same prompt and model configuration are requested again THEN the system SHALL return cached results within 50ms
3. WHEN cache storage exceeds configured limits THEN the system SHALL implement LRU eviction policy
4. WHEN model configurations change THEN the system SHALL invalidate related cached results automatically

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a user comparing model performance, I want accurate timing and performance metrics for non-streaming outputs, so that I can make informed decisions about model selection.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN non-streaming inference completes THEN the system SHALL provide accurate total inference time excluding display overhead
2. WHEN measuring performance THEN the system SHALL distinguish between model loading time, inference time, and result processing time
3. WHEN displaying metrics THEN the system SHALL show tokens per second based on actual generation time, not display time
4. WHEN comparing streaming vs non-streaming performance THEN the system SHALL provide separate metric categories for each mode
